#ChordChart App

This app was inspired by Ultimate Guitar along with some of Google Drive's design. I like being able to save chord charts because I play music a lot, which is kind of where the app idea came from. Chord Chart uses this technology called Devise Auth, which prompts users to log in or create an account, and I have it set up in a way that users would need to create an account first if they'd like to use the app.

###Instructions

1. Create an account.

2. After creating an account, you'll be able to read, update, or delete any documents you have created.

* Ruby version 2.2.3

###Try the app!
